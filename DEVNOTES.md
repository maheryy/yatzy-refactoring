# Yatzy Refactoring Kata

## Work time : 55 minutes

## Notes : 
- Created utils functions (with related tests) to avoid any code duplication
- The public functions (fours, fives, sixes) were turned into static in order to keep usage consistency
- Some of the Yatzy's categories were redesigned in order to be more flexible with a more generic way.
